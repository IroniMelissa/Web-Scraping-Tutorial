# Web-Scraping-Tutorial
Web scraping is an automatic method to obtain large amounts of data from websites. Most of this data is unstructured data in an HTML format which is then converted into structured data in a spreadsheet or a database so that it can be used in various applications. 

## Steps of web scraping
- Find the URL that you want to scrape.
- Inspecting the Page.
- Find the data you want to extract.
- Write the code.
- Run the code and extract the data.
- Store the data in the required format.

Used libraries,
- Python Requests for sending , recieving HTTP.
- BeautifulSoup for pulling data from htmml, xml.

In this project, I used https://www.flipkart.com/ ecommerce website to extract product name, price and ratings of iphones.
After extarction of data, I did some data transformation before save to the csv file.
